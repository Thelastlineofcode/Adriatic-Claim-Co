1. Agentic Planning (BMAD Phase 1)
A. The Analyst (Market Research & Ideation)

Analyze the clientele: Through market research agents, identify individuals and organizations holding unclaimed assets in Houston, Texas, and assess demographics such as language, geography, and needs. Compare local requirements (Texas Property Code, dormancy tests, compliance) and document online and out-of-state market dynamics.​

Determine differentiation: Benchmark existing services. Ask, "What gaps exist in service quality, pricing transparency, or accessibility that we can address?" Use AI-driven tools for researching both conventional competitors and digital platforms.​

Core values articulation: Map the core brand values relevant to the unclaimed property sector, e.g., trustworthiness, transparency, service to underserved populations, and expertise in legal compliance.​

Fee philosophy: Research market averages and develop your value proposition accordingly, for example, competitive contingency rates, reduced barriers (no upfront payment), or premium "white-glove" service.​

Scope definition: Decide, through competitive analysis, if you'll offer only state-level claims or expand to federal, bankruptcy, or multi-state property searches.​

B. Product Manager (Requirements & Specification)

Service model clarity: Detail requirements for running the business remotely—digital intake forms, remote ID validation, e-signatures, and compliance automation.

Positioning: Use user profiles and market segmentation to determine if your identity is "Houston’s Local Expert" or a "Tech-forward Remote Claims Service".

Value Statement: Draft a brand mission/vision statement synthesizing unique value, key differentiators, and operational model.​

C. Architect (System & Brand Design)

Visual and trust design: Select brand colors, fonts, and graphics that visually communicate responsibility and financial security while distinguishing you from government portals.​

Communication pipeline: Architect a customer journey—from initial contact, through documentation, filing, progress updates, and claim payout.

Lean structure representation: If automation is your focus, design systems that highlight tech efficiency or keep the automation invisible and present a human-focused front.​

2. Context-Engineered Development (BMAD Phase 2)
A. Epic Sharding (Brand Implementation Breakdown)

Shard the PRD (from BMAD planning) into actionable tasks: marketing copy, website flow, FAQ content, outreach templates, compliance scripts.

Ensure every task or asset relates back to core values, differentiation, and compliance commitments.

B. Scrum Master & Developer Roles

Brand storytelling: Develop content that emotionally resonates with claimants—focus on clarity, relief, and empowerment.

Visual guidelines documentation: Codify logo use, imagery standards, document templates, and communication tone.

Continuous review: AI and human quality checks ensure that messaging, visuals, and process steps remain consistent with initial BMAD planning documents.

C. QA/Compliance

Traceability: Every customer touchpoint and claim must be verifiably tied to your brand’s promise of transparency and legal compliance (audit-ready documentation).​

Governance: Maintain clear records of decision logs, policy changes, and naming rationale—build these into your Brand.md, Visual Guidelines.md, and Brand_Naming_History.md files.
