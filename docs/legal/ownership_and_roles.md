# Ownership, Roles, and Compliance Notes

Purpose: capture the agreed company roles and a compliance checklist to validate investigator/licensure requirements for operating in Texas. This is a working document and not legal advice. Consult a Texas-licensed attorney for binding guidance.

Summary of current arrangement

- Owner: (wife) — legal owner of the business; holds controlling ownership and signs contracts on behalf of the company.
- Admin: (you) — operational administrator and system operator; responsible for day-to-day operations, platform administration, and bookkeeping.
- Investigator: (son-in-law) — performs investigative work and claim discovery; holds an existing level-4 security license and previous experience as a bounty hunter.

High-level questions to validate

1. Does Texas law require a specific private investigator or security license for conducting unclaimed-money discovery, outreach, or filing activities on behalf of claimants? If so, is the son-in-law's existing license (level 4 security) sufficient, or is an additional PI/claims investigator license required?
2. If investigator activities include acting as a filing agent, executing POAs, or handling funds, are there bonding or additional registration requirements?
3. Should the investigator be an employee or an independent contractor for tax, insurance, and liability reasons?

Recommended company structure & governance (operational recommendations)

- Entity: Consider an LLC (single- or multi-member) or other pass-through entity. Have the owner (wife) listed as the legal owner/member in the formation documents. Discuss S-corp election with an accountant if you plan salary + distributions.
- Operating Agreement / Bylaws: Draft and maintain an operating agreement that explicitly documents:
  - Owner equity and voting rights
  - Roles and responsibilities (owner, admin, investigator)
  - Decision thresholds for legal / financial actions
  - Profit-sharing / fee splits and vesting (if the investigator has equity or performance-based pay)
- Role Contracts:
  - Investigator Agreement: clearly defines duties, permitted activities, licensing requirements, compensation, confidentiality, and data handling expectations.
  - Admin Services Agreement (if you are not an employee): scope of admin duties, access rights, and indemnities.
  - Employment Contracts: if investigator is an employee, include benefits, payroll setup, withholding, and worker protections.

Compliance, licensing & insurance checklist (action items)

- [ ] Verify Texas-specific investigator/private security licensing requirements with the relevant state agency and a Texas attorney.
- [ ] Obtain and keep records of the investigator's license(s), background checks, and any required bonds.
- [ ] Decide investigator status (employee vs contractor). If employee, register for payroll taxes and workers' comp as required.
- [ ] Purchase insurance: professional liability / E&O, general liability, cyber liability (for PII handling), and fidelity/bonding if handling funds.
- [ ] Update Finder Agreement and Fee Disclosure templates to reference the investigator role and include clear consent for data handling, POA, and partner-sharing.
- [ ] Add consent language for selling/licensing leads or data to partners (if you pursue B2B revenue), and store signed consent per privacy law best practices.

Operational controls & data practices

- Limit access to PII: Use RBAC so only the investigator and necessary staff can access sensitive fields.
- Audit logging: Keep auditable records of who accessed or exported claimant data.
- Retention policy: Define and publish (internally) retention timelines for claim records, IDs, and signed agreements.

Next legal steps (recommended)

1. Book a consultation with a Texas-licensed attorney experienced in private investigator, unclaimed property, or consumer financial services — bring this repo and the Finder Agreement draft.
2. Decide employment classification and draft an Investigator Agreement (I can scaffold one if you want).
3. After counsel review, update `docs/Finder_Agreement_Texas.md` and `docs/Fee_Disclosure.md` to explicitly include the investigator role and any consent language.
