Fee Summary (Texas claimants)

- No Upfront Fees: Adriatic Claim Co does not charge any upfront fees. You will not owe anything unless we successfully recover funds for you.
- Contingency Fee: For claims handled under Texas law, Adriatic Claim Co's fee is 10% of the gross amount recovered (the maximum allowed by Texas law). This is deducted from the recovered funds before we disburse the remainder to you.
- Flat-Fee Option: For very small claims (under $500) Adriatic Claim Co offers a transparent flat-fee option starting at $49 — Adriatic Claim Co will show you the choice during intake so you can decide which option maximizes your take-home.
- Costs & Expenses: Any out-of-pocket costs (notarization, filing fees) will be disclosed in advance. Adriatic Claim Co will not deduct such costs from your recovery unless you agree in writing.
- Example: If your recovery is $1,000 and you accept the contingency option, Adriatic Claim Co's fee will be $100 and you will receive $900 (subject to any applicable processing fees).
