Finder Agreement

This Finder Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into on this **\_ day of **\_\_\_\_\*\*\*\*, 20\_\_ ("Effective Date"), by and between:

- Finder: Adriatic Claim Co, a [State] [entity type], with principal place of business at [Address] ("Finder"); and
- Client: [Client Full Name], residing at [Client Address] ("Client").

1. Scope of Services

- Finder will use commercially reasonable efforts to search for and assist Client in recovering unclaimed property as defined by the Texas Property Code and applicable state programs. Services include identification of potential unclaimed property, preparation and submission of claim forms to the relevant custodian (for Texas claims, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts), and reasonable follow-up.

2. Contingency Fee and Costs

- For claims handled under Texas law, Finder's fee shall be TEN PERCENT (10%) of the gross recovery amount received by Client (the "Fee"), which is the maximum fee allowed under Texas Property Code §72.305. The Fee shall be deducted from the gross proceeds before delivery to Client.
- Finder shall not charge any upfront fee. Finder shall disclose any out-of-pocket costs (e.g., notarization, filing fees) in advance; such costs may be deducted from recovery only if explicitly agreed in writing.

3. Payment Timing

- Finder will be entitled to its Fee only upon actual receipt of recovered funds by Client or Finder acting as agent to receive funds. Fees are payable at that time, and Finder will disburse Client's remainder promptly (within [X] business days).

4. Client Representations and Documentation

- Client represents that they are legally entitled to pursue the claim and will provide truthful, complete documentation, including government-issued photo ID, proof of address, and any other documents required by the custodian. Client authorizes Finder to submit required documentation on Client's behalf.

5. Authorization and Power of Attorney

- If required by the custodian, Client will grant Finder a limited power of attorney to act on Client's behalf for the single purpose of preparing and filing the Claim identified in this Agreement. Any POA shall be limited in scope and terminable upon completion of the Claim.

6. No Guarantee of Recovery

- Finder will use reasonable efforts but does not guarantee recovery of funds. If no recovery occurs, Client will owe no Fee.

7. Confidentiality

- Finder will treat Client information as confidential and will not sell or share Client personal data with third parties for marketing purposes without Client's explicit consent. Finder may disclose personal data where required by law.

8. Termination

- Either party may terminate this Agreement in writing prior to any filing. If Finder has already incurred out-of-pocket costs with Client consent, Client may be responsible for those costs even if there is no recovery.

9. Dispute Resolution

- Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall be resolved in the courts of the state of Texas. [Optional: binding arbitration clause only if reviewed and accepted by counsel and consistent with state law.]

10. Compliance

- Finder certifies that this Agreement and the Finder's practices comply with Texas Property Code §72.305 and all applicable consumer-protection laws. Finder will maintain records of searches, filings, and client communications for at least [X] years.

11. Acceptance
