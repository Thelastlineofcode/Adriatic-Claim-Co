**Fee Basis:** Contingent only (no upfront payment allowed)  
**Disclosure:** Written Finder Agreement required before services commence  
**Enforcement:** Texas Attorney General (vigorous prosecution of violations)  
**Penalty:** Fees exceeding 10% are unenforceable in court; potential criminal prosecution

### Universal Best Practices (All States)

✓ **Written Agreement:** Mandatory signed contract between finder and client  
✓ **Fee Percentage:** Must be stated explicitly (no vague language)  
✓ **Estimated Timeline:** Realistic expectations required

## SECTION 4: COMPLAINT PATTERNS & ANALYSIS

### Very High Frequency: Fee Surprise (40-45% of complaints)
**Root Cause:** Unclear upfront disclosure; fee structure buried in ToS  
**Typical Scenario:** Finder deducts $500 from $5,000 recovery without explicit pre-disclosure  
**Common Resolution:** Fee renegotiation or partial refund  
**Legal Recourse:** Small claims court, BBB complaint, State AG complaint, Arbitration  
**Prevention:** Detailed written Finder Agreement; specific fee % stated; client signature required  
**Providers with Issues:** Multiple (industry-wide); Sparrow ToS noted[27]

### High Frequency: Lack of Communication (25-30%)
**Root Cause:** High case volume; Resource constraints; Poor CRM systems  
**Typical Scenario:** Client can't reach finder for weeks during claim process  
**Common Resolution:** Escalation + regular email/phone updates  
**Legal Recourse:** BBB complaint, State AG complaint, potential class action  
**Prevention:** Weekly status updates, establish communication SLA, callback commitment  
**Providers with Issues:** Generic finder services most common

### Moderate-High: Delayed Payment Processing (15-20%)

**Legal Recourse:** Attorney General complaint, state regulatory board  
**Prevention:** Regular status updates, realistic timeline expectations, escalation process

**Root Cause:** Aggressive marketing claims; misaligned consumer expectations  
**Typical Scenario:** Ad claims "$15,000 average recovery" but actual average is $3,000  
**Common Resolution:** Client education about limitations; potential partial refund  
**Legal Recourse:** BBB complaint, FTC complaint, potential refund demand  
**Prevention:** Conservative marketing copy, under-promise/over-deliver, honest testimonials  
**Providers with Issues:** Aggressive marketers; pre-escheat notification firms

### Moderate: Harassment During Collection (10-12%)
**Root Cause:** Third-party collection agency involvement; threatening tactics  
**Typical Scenario:** Repeated calls after claiming no interest in service  
**Common Resolution:** Cease communication demand; legal threat; FTC complaint  
**Legal Recourse:** Restraining order, police report, FTC complaint  
**Prevention:** Professional communication only, no third-party debt collectors  
**Providers with Issues:** Asset Recovery Inc. (BBB complaints)[54]

### Low: Unauthorized Charges/Fraud (5-8%)
**Root Cause:** Technical payment processing failures or intentional fraud  
**Typical Scenario:** Charged for service never rendered  
**Common Resolution:** Credit card chargeback; dispute resolution  
**Legal Recourse:** Credit card company, fraud dispute, police report  
**Prevention:** Clear payment authorization, pre-authorization consent, secure payment gateway  
**Providers with Issues:** Rare for unclaimed property (more common with fintech products)

### Low: Non-Performance/No Results (3-5%)
**Root Cause:** Inadequate due diligence by finder firm  
**Typical Scenario:** Finder charges but property not actually located  
**Common Resolution:** Refund (if no work done); legal action
